Problem 4:
Code is written in Matlab. 
For question (i), Q4_1_1.m, Q4_1_2.m and Q4_1_3.m are main files for perceptron v0, v1 and v2. It produces plots of different training and testing splits.
For question (ii), Q4_2_1.m, Q4_2_2.m and Q4_2_3.m are main files for perceptron v0, v1 and v2. It produces plots of different number of iterations.
For question (iii), Q4_3_1.m is the main file. It runs kernel perceptron of v0, produces plots of different training and testing splits. At training-testing size ratio 8:2, error rate is about 9%, which is better than the original v0.

Problem 5:
Code is in Python Jupyter Notebook. We use 10 neurons to train neural network. And our final loss is 0.0004.
